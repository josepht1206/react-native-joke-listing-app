In this assessment I have built a Joke Listing App based on what I have learnt from the training materials. I have learnt some basics of React Native from the training. React Native is a framework that can be utilised to develop hybrid applications including Android, and IOS. 

From what I did, I have created a react native app with expo using nodeJS, the code is programmed in Visual Studio Code IDE, and Android Studio to run the emulator and display the UI. There are a few functions developed in this application. Firstly, the users are able to view the randomly generated 5 jokes with the filter of categories such as Programming, Misc, or Dark. The data can be fetched from the JokeAPI using the Axios library that is supported by react native. Then, the users are able to add the jokes by clicking the love button and add it into the saved list as well as view the saved jokes. Not only that, users can add, edit and delete the jokes to and from the saved list. The data can be saved and loaded using the AsyncStorage, thus the data is persisted. Lastly, users are able to navigate between different screens when performing the function operations.
